## Project Structure
iOS Project implemented with Clean Layered Architecture and MVVM-Coordinator pattern. 

## Layers
* **Domain Layer** = Entities + Use Cases + Repositories Interfaces
* **Data Repositories Layer** = Repositories Implementations + API (Network)
* **Presentation Layer (MVVM)** = ViewModels + Views

### Dependency Direction

* **AstronomyApp**(iOS Project): This folder contains the resources, source files and all other miscellaneous files to build the iOS project. This folder is further branched into:
	 The app is completely written in SwiftUI/Combine.

## What needs to be improved ##
### Required
1. Improve UI test coverage.
2. Improve unit test coverage.
3. Add Snapshot testing.
4. Integrate Analytics.
5. Integrate A/B testing
5. Add [Circuit Breaker](https://medium.com/@gitaeklee/ios-circuitbreaker-with-swift-and-async-await-dbbb2a0cddc3) for handling network resilience.

### Tools have the capacity to be incorporated.
 1. - [Arkana](https://github.com/rogerluan/arkana) is used to handle/manage/store project keys secretely.
Arkana requires the declaration of a YAML config file, named e.g. `.arkana.yml` that lists the keys (names) and an `.env` (e.g. `.env.arkana`) file that stores the values for the keys stored in the YAML file. Since the `.env.arkana` file contains the actual values of the secrets, it should be stored locally and never be checked-in to the repository (It has already been added to `.gitignore`).
2. - [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) is a tool allowing to parse the app's various assets (including but not limited to xibs, storyboards, fonts, assets library, strings file, etc). This app is built to use SwiftGen to generate 3 kinds of compile-time constants related to:
3. - [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/) is a tool that parses `swift` files, and output warnings when a code-smell is identified. Sometimes, SwiftLint outputs warnings for desired code, and in these cases the warnings may be disabled in code.
